#### Code Coverage

The project uses `pytest-cov` (a wrapper around coverage.py) for test coverage analysis. **Run coverage analysis on every code change to determine if new tests are needed.**

```bash
# Basic coverage report (terminal output with missing lines)
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Coverage with branch analysis (recommended)
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-branch

# Generate HTML coverage report for detailed analysis
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-branch

# Set coverage threshold (fail if below 80%)
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80 --cov-branch

# Coverage from end-to-end tests only
coverage run tools/run_e2e_tests.py
coverage report --show-missing

# Combined coverage: unit tests + e2e tests
coverage run -m pytest
coverage run -a tools/run_e2e_tests.py
coverage report --show-missing
coverage html

# Run all tests with combined coverage (recommended)
coverage erase && coverage run -m pytest && coverage run -a tools/run_e2e_tests.py && coverage report --show-missing
```

**Coverage Analysis:**
- **Unit Tests Only**: 73% statement coverage 
- **Combined (Unit + E2E)**: 91% statement coverage ‚≠ê

**Module Breakdown (Combined Coverage):**
- **üü¢ Excellent (100%)**: `inputparser.py` - command parsing fully tested
- **üü¢ Excellent (95%)**: `actions.py` - game actions comprehensively covered
- **üü¢ Good (93%)**: `delivery.py` - event system well tested by e2e
- **üü¢ Good (87%)**: `io_interface.py` - I/O abstractions mostly covered  
- **üü¢ Good (80%)**: `gamestate.py` - core game objects well exercised
- **üü¢ Good (77%)**: `gameloop.py` - main game loop tested via e2e
- **üü† Fair (80%)**: `alterego.py` - placeholder system (1 line missing)

**Key Insight**: E2E tests dramatically improve coverage by exercising the full game loop and real user interactions that unit tests miss.

### Key Game Mechanics

- **Feel System**: Player energy that decreases over time, causes passing out at 0, restored by eating
- **Money System**: Player has $100 starting balance, can order items by phone with costs deducted
- **Time System**: All actions advance time, some significantly (pondering, phone calls)
- **Inventory**: Weight-based system, hero can carry up to 100 weight units
- **Room Navigation**: Movement between apartment rooms with special closet mechanics
- **Store Orders**: Phone-based ordering system with delivery scheduling

  - **Action Replay**: Commands can be recorded and replayed for debugging
  - **Macro Commands**: Complex sequences can be combined into single commands
  - **Command Queuing**: Commands can be queued and executed in batches
  - **AI Compatibility**: AI agents can use same command objects as humans

### Special Features

- **Closet Nailing**: Player can nail themselves into the closet using hammer, nails, and plywood (both nails and plywood are consumed)
- **Phone System**: Three numbers - grocery store (288-7955), hardware store (592-2874), and building super (198-2888)
- **TV News**: Shows astrophysics anomaly news when examined
- **Food System**: Different foods provide different feel boosts (spicy-food: 30, caffeine: 20, bananas: 5, ice-cubes: 2)
- **Hardware Items**: Hammer ($20), box-of-nails ($5), plywood-sheet ($30)

### State Management

The game uses a centralized `GameState` object that contains:
- `apartment`: The apartment container with all rooms and objects
- `hero`: Player character with stats and inventory
- `watch`: Time tracking object (Watch class)
- `event_queue`: Scheduled events system (EventQueue class)
- `alterEgo`: AlterEgo system (currently unused)
- `io`: IOInterface for all input/output operations

All game objects maintain parent-child relationships for location tracking, and the `@sameroom` decorator ensures actions only work when the player is in the same room as objects.

### Object Hierarchy Details

**Object Classes:**
- `Object`: Base class with name, weight, parent
- `Food`: Extends Object, has feelBoost property and Eat() method
- `Container`: Extends Object, has contents list and item lookup methods
- `Openable`: Extends Container, adds open/closed state with Open()/Close() methods
- `Room`: Extends Container, base class for game locations with Enter()/Leave() methods
- `Hero`: Extends Container, player character with feel, curr_balance, and Pickup() logic
- `Watch`: Extends Object, tracks current game time with GetDateAsString() method
- `Phone`: Extends Object, handles phone calls with list of PhoneNumber objects
- `TV`: Extends Object, displays news when examined

**Specialized Rooms:**
- `MainRoom`: Contains phone, toolbox, fridge, cabinet, table, tv
- `Closet`: Can be nailed shut, prevents leaving when CLOSET_NAILED state
- `Apartment`: Top-level container holding all rooms

**Phone System:**
- `PhoneNumber`: Base class for callable numbers
- `StoreNumber`: Abstract base for stores with ordering logic
- `GroceryNumber`: Grocery store with food items and next-day delivery
- `HardwareNumber`: Hardware store with tools and 2-day delivery
- `SuperNumber`: Building super who never answers

## Testing Architecture & Design Principles

The codebase has been refactored to follow testable design patterns:

### I/O Abstraction (`src/io_interface.py`)

**Interface Pattern**: All user interaction goes through the `IOInterface` abstraction:
- `ConsoleIO`: Real console I/O for gameplay
- `MockIO`: Test implementation that records outputs and provides scripted inputs

**Benefits**:
- Tests run instantly without blocking on user input
- Deterministic testing with pre-configured responses
- Complete verification of all game output

### Dependency Injection

**Pattern**: Core classes accept their dependencies as constructor parameters:
```python
# Before: Hard-coded dependencies
def some_method(self):
    print("message")  # Hard to test

# After: Injected dependencies
def some_method(self):
    self.io.output("message")  # Easily mockable
```

**Implementation**:
- `GameState(io: IOInterface = None)` - accepts optional IO interface, defaults to ConsoleIO
- `Hero(startRoom: Room, io: IOInterface)` - requires IO for interactions
- All game objects use `hero.io` for output instead of direct `print()`

### Pure Business Logic

**Separation of Concerns**: Core game logic is separated from I/O side effects:
- **Pure Functions**: Game mechanics like inventory rules, time calculations
- **Stateful Objects**: Game state management without I/O coupling
- **I/O Layer**: User interface completely abstracted away

### Test Structure

**Test Categories**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual object behavior (`TestHero`, `TestContainer`)
- **Integration Tests**: Object interactions and game mechanics
- **Mock Tests**: User interaction scenarios with scripted inputs
- **Command Pattern Tests**: Complete command system testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full game flow testing with FileCheck-like tool

**Test Files**:
- `tests/test_gamestate.py`: Core game objects and state management
- `tests/test_actions.py`: Action functions and game mechanics
- `tests/test_apartment.py`: Room and apartment structure
- `tests/test_io_interface.py`: I/O interface implementations
- `tests/test_inputparser.py`: Command parsing system
- `tests/test_delivery.py`: Event queue system
- `tests/test_gameloop.py`: Main game loop functionality
- `tests/test_alterego.py`: AlterEgo system (placeholder)
- **`tests/test_command_pattern.py`: Command pattern implementation (29 tests)**

**Test Fixtures**: Each test gets fresh instances to prevent test pollution:
```python
def setup_method(self):
    self.mock_io = MockIO()
    self.state = GameState(self.mock_io)
    self.hero = self.state.hero
```

### Best Practices for New Features

When adding new features, follow these patterns:

1. **Accept IO Interface**: New classes should accept `IOInterface` parameter
2. **Use Dependency Injection**: Don't create dependencies internally, accept them
3. **Separate Logic from I/O**: Keep business logic pure, delegate I/O to interface
4. **Write Tests First**: Use `MockIO` to script interactions and verify outputs
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Cover error conditions, boundary values, and state transitions
6. **Add E2E Tests**: Create FileCheck tests for new gameplay features
7. **Use Command Pattern**: Convert actions to Command objects for undo/redo support
8. **Modern Python 3.13+**: Use latest Python features and type hints

**Command Pattern Example**:
```python
# Good: Command-based design
class NewActionCommand(BaseCommand):
    def __init__(self, parameter: str):
        super().__init__(f"New action: {parameter}")
        self.parameter = parameter

    def execute(self, game_state: GameState) -> CommandResult:
        # Pure business logic
        result = self._process_action(game_state, self.parameter)
        self.mark_executed()
        return CommandResult(
            success=True,
            message=f"Action completed: {result}"
        )

    def can_undo(self) -> bool:
        return True

    def undo(self, game_state: GameState) -> CommandResult:
        # Reverse the action
        self._reverse_action(game_state, self.parameter)
        return CommandResult(success=True, message="Action undone")
```

This architecture ensures all new code is testable, maintainable, follows separation of concerns, and supports advanced features like undo/redo.

- **Command Pattern**: Convert actions to Command objects for undo/redo support
- **MockIO Testing**: Use the MockIO interface for testing interactive features
- **Logic Separation**: Separate business logic from I/O operations
- **Design Patterns**: Follow existing architectural patterns (Command, Observer, Factory)

### Modern Python 3.13+ Practices
- **Enhanced Type Hints**: Use latest typing features and union syntax
- **Pattern Matching**: Utilize match/case statements where appropriate
- **Dataclasses**: Use dataclasses for data containers
- **Context Managers**: Use context managers for resource management
- **Async/Await**: Use async patterns where beneficial (future consideration)
